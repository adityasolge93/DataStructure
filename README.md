# Welcome to DataStructure Library
## What is this library about?
The purpose of this library is to keep all the Data Structures in a single place. 
One can use these for learning Data Structures or revising Data structures for purposes 
like interviews. All the Data Structures are implemented in Java.

## What does it contain now?
This library currently contains all the sorting algorithms with future development of the 
following in the same order
1. Searching Algorithms
2. Stack, Queue, and LinkedList
3. Tree and Graph

The library will contain generic implementations of all Data Structures 
(except sorting and searching algorithms), and additionally, solutions to interview questions 
will also be added.

## Can I contribute?
This library aims to help all learners (students, working professionals, or anyone), and 
if you would like to contribute to a new Data Structure, Algorithm, or Coding Question, 
feel free to raise Pull Request.
